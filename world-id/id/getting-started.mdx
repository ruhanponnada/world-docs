<Steps>
  <Step>
  Create an application in our [Developer Portal](http://developer.worldcoin.org/)
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Retrieve user's verification proof using an IDkit library
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Verify the proof
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Step 1: Create an application in the Developer Portal">
   When you create your application you'll choose **External** as the integration type. External apps use IDKit to collect proofs from your end-users and return them to your backend for verification.

### Decide upfront

1. **Environment**
	• **Production** – Real Human World IDs.
	• **Staging / Development** – internal testing against the test identities.
2. **Verification target**
	• **Cloud** – verify proofs via a REST endpoint.
	• **On-chain** – verify proofs directly inside a smart contract.

Once you create the application you'll need to create an incognito action.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Retrieve a proof with IDKit">
    IDKit is available for multiple runtimes so you can collect proofs wherever your users are:

| Platform | Docs |
| --- | --- |
| Web (React) | [Integrate on the web](https://docs.world.org/world-id/id/web-react) |
| Web (Vanilla) | [Integrate on the web](https://docs.world.org/world-id/id/web-vanilla) |
| Mobile (React Native, Swift, Kotlin) | [Integrate on mobile](https://docs.world.org/world-id/id/mobile) |

</Info>

Regardless of the platform the flow is the same:

1. Initiate a verification session with a minimum `verification_level`
2. User will be redirect or prompted to use the World App
3. When the user succeeds you receive a **proof object** containing `merkle_root`, `nullifier_hash`, `proof`, and the user's `verification_level`.


```yaml ISuccessResult
{
	"merkle_root": "0x1f38b57f3bdf96f05ea62fa68814871bf0ca8ce4dbe073d8497d5a6b0a53e5e0",
	"nullifier_hash": "0x0339861e70a9bdb6b01a88c7534a3332db915d3d06511b79a5724221a6958fbe",
	"proof": "0x063942fd7ea1616f17787d2e3374c1826ebcd2d41d2394...",
	"verification_level": "orb"
}
```
<Warning>
Retrieving the proof is not enough. You must verify the proof in Step 3 to prevent replay attacks. Without verification, your application could be vulnerable to malicious actors reusing old proofs.
</Warning>

  </Step>

   <Step title="Verify the proof">
    Choose where you want to verify proofs:

| Target | Recommended when | Docs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cloud verifier | You already maintain a backend server and prefer a simple REST call | [Verify via REST](https://docs.world.org/world-id/id/cloud) |
| On-chain verifier | You need trust-minimized verification inside a smart contract | [Verify on-chain](https://docs.world.org/world-id/id/on-chain) |

<Info>
Cloud verifications from the Developer portal automatically handle sybil-resistance for you, ensuring that a user cannot perform the same action more than a set amount. If you want to verify proofs on-chain you need to handle this, more details [here](https://docs.world.org/world-id/id/on-chain)
