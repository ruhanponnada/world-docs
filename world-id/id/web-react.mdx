- [**Widget**](https://docs.world.org/world-id/id/web-react#id-kit-widget): A plug-and-play widget that handles UI/State management for you. Find an example [here](https://github.com/worldcoin/idkit-js/tree/main/examples/with-next)
- [**Session API**](https://docs.world.org/world-id/id/web-react#session-hook): A react hook that gives you total control of the user journey and UI/State management. Find an example [here](https://github.com/worldcoin/idkit-js/tree/main/examples/with-session).

## Install


```yaml
npm i @worldcoin/idkit
```

## IDKitWidget

First, add the `IDKitWidget` component to your site. The values for the `app_id` and `action` props were obtained from the Developer Portal in [Getting Started](https://docs.world.org/world-id/idkit/getting-started). We'll define the `handleVerify` and `onSuccess` callbacks next.


```yaml /verify.tsx
'use client' // for Next.js app router
import { IDKitWidget, VerificationLevel, ISuccessResult } from '@worldcoin/idkit'

// ...
;<IDKitWidget
	app_id="your app id" // obtained from the Developer Portal
	action="your action id" // obtained from the Developer Portal
	onSuccess={onSuccess} // callback when the modal is closed
	handleVerify={handleVerify} // callback when the proof is received
	verification_level={VerificationLevel.Orb}
	language="en" // th | en | es
>
	{({ open }) => (
		// This is the button that will open the IDKit modal
		<button onClick={open}>Verify with World ID</button>
	)}
</IDKitWidget>
```

### Localization

You can localize the IDKit modal by passing the `language` prop. By default it will try to detect the user's browser language via the `navigator.language` property.


```yaml /verify.tsx
<IDKitWidget language="en" />
```

### handleVerify

The `handleVerify` callback is called when the user's proof is received. This will send the proof to your backend for verification:

```yaml  /verify.tsx
const handleVerify = async (proof: ISuccessResult) => {
	const res = await fetch('/api/verify', {
		// route to your backend will depend on implementation
		method: 'POST',
		headers: {
			'Content-Type': 'application/json',
		},
		body: JSON.stringify(proof),
	})
	if (!res.ok) {
		throw new Error('Verification failed.') // IDKit will display the error message to the user in the modal
	}
}
```

### Verifying the proof

The `handleVerify` callback sends the proof to your backend for verification. In the backend handler should verify the proof with the Developer Portal API:

<Warning>
The call to the Developer Portal API must be made server-side to avoid [man in the middle attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack).
</Warning>


```yaml /api/verify.ts
import { type IVerifyResponse, verifyCloudProof } from '@worldcoin/idkit-core'

export default async function handler(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {
	const proof = req.body
	const app_id = process.env.APP_ID
	const action = process.env.ACTION_ID
	const verifyRes = (await verifyCloudProof(proof, app_id, action)) as IVerifyResponse

	if (verifyRes.success) {
		// This is where you should perform backend actions if the verification succeeds
		// Such as, setting a user as "verified" in a database
		res.status(200).send(verifyRes)
	} else {
		// This is where you should handle errors from the World ID /verify endpoint.
		// Usually these errors are due to a user having already verified.
		res.status(400).send(verifyRes)
	}
}
```

<Info>
If you want to verify the proof onchain read more about it [here](https://docs.world.org/world-id/id/on-chain).
</Info>

### onSuccess

The `onSuccess` callback is called when the user closes the modal. This is where you can perform any necessary actions, such as redirecting the user to a new page.

```yaml /verify.tsx
const onSuccess = () => {
	// This is where you should perform any actions after the modal is closed
	// Such as redirecting the user to a new page
	window.location.href = '/success'
}
```

## Session Hook

First, setup the session hook with your configuration:

```yaml /verify.tsx
const { status, sessionURI, result, errorCode } = useSession({
	app_id: 'your app id',
	action: 'your action id',
})
```

After that you need to handle the following possible statuses:

- **WaitingForConnection**: Display the `sessionURI` to the user eg. with a QR code
- **Confirmed**: Session ended successfully, now you **must** verify the `result` proof in your backend.
- **Failed**: Session failed, check `errorCode`
