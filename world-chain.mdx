 World chain offers several unique primitives:

- Free gas fees for all verified humans
- Native mobile distribution to all World App users through [mini-apps](https://docs.world.org/mini-apps)
- Simplified crypto transactions [through mini apps](https://docs.world.org/mini-apps/commands/verify)
- Sybil resistance for developers via [World ID](https://docs.world.org/world-id)
- Airdrop of WLD tokens to all verified humans

These primitives enable World Chain builders to build never before possible applications and reach a global audience.

World Chain is built on the [Superchain](https://docs.optimism.io/superchain/superchain-explainer).
